# AI Racism: How Racially Biased Data Affects Machine Learning Results

## Project Description
This research project, conducted under the guidance of Dr. Elizabeth Hewitt in EST 441: Interdisciplinary Senior Project, investigates the impact of racially based data on machine learning results. By analyzing data from cdc.gov and bea.gov, the project seeks to uncover potential biases in AI algorithms and their implications.

## Installation and Setup
Before running the analysis, ensure that Python 3 is installed on your system. If not, download and install it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

This project requires the following Python packages:
- pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
- matplotlib: For creating static, interactive, and animated visualizations.
- seaborn: For making statistical graphics.
- scikit-learn: For machine learning and data mining.
- numpy: For numerical computing.

You can install all required packages using `pip` with the following command:

```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn numpy
```
The analyses are carried out using Jupyter Notebooks. To run the notebooks, you will need Jupyter installed, which can be done by installing Anaconda (which includes all the necessary packages) or by following Jupyter's official installation guide if you prefer a minimal setup.

After installing the necessary packages, you can clone the repository to your local machine, navigate to the cloned directory, and launch Jupyter Notebooks with jupyter notebook. From there, open the .ipynb files to view the analyses and run cells sequentially.

## Usage
To use this research repository:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the cloned directory.
3. Launch Jupyter Notebooks with `jupyter notebook`.
4. Open the `.ipynb` files to view the analyses and run cells sequentially.

## Python Scripts
The repository includes the following Python scripts that are pivotal for the analysis:
- `Feature Importance_SEP + Race.py`: Analyzes the importance of various features including education level, race or Hispanic origin, sex, and age group in predicting COVID-19 deaths.
- `Feature Importance_By County.py`: Examines the impact of race, urban-rural description, and income per capita on COVID-19 death rates by county.
- `Racial_Prescription_analysis.py`: Evaluates the risk assessment by race/ethnicity, sex, and age group, showcasing potential biases in prescription practices.

## Results
The `results` folder contains PNG images representing the visualizations generated by the scripts:
- `Result-Racial Prescription.png` & `Result-Racial Prescription ver2.png`: Heatmaps showing the proportion of risky individuals by sex, age group, and race/ethnicity.
- `Result-Feature Importance SEP + Race.png` & `Result-Feature Importance By_County.png`: Bar plots displaying the feature importances for predicting COVID-19 deaths and death rates, respectively.

## Contributing
If you are interested in contributing to this research, please:
1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch for your feature.
3. Add your changes.
4. Commit your changes and push to your fork.
